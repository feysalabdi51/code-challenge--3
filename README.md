SIMPLE BLOG APP

A lightweight, single-page blog manager built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. This app connects to a local mock REST API using `json-server` to manage blog posts — including viewing, adding, editing, and deleting them.

Problem This Project Solves

Most beginner blog applications either lack full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations or are too complex for new developers. This project provides a clear, minimal, and fully functional CRUD interface** — ideal for learning DOM manipulation,event handling, and API communication using JavaScript.
